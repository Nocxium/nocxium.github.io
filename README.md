# About me
I am a passionate Computer Engineer from Sweden, currently completing my final project this summer.

With a strong interest in open-source projects—particularly Linux—over the past 15 years, I have recently begun contributing to these projects during my spare time. Outside of coding, I am also passionate about self-hosting, containerization, cybersecurity and AI. This page is mainly about introducing some of the projects I've worked on during my studies or my spare time.

## Projects
### [Emergency Bracelet Project](https://github.com/Nocxium/Emergency-bracelet)
This projects aim is to provide a device that mainly can monitor if a person is in danger in form of a potential fall accident or a possible medical seizure. This IoT-device is in the form of an bracelet that is thought to be worn by the user and in case of emergency a message will be sent to example relatives of the user so that they can either contact the user or ultimately SOS.
