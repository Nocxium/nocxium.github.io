# About me
I am a passionate Computer Engineer from Sweden, currently completing my final project this summer.

With a strong interest in open-source projects—particularly Linux—over the past 15 years, I have recently begun contributing to these projects during my spare time. Outside of coding, I am also passionate about self-hosting, containerization, cybersecurity and AI. This page is mainly about introducing some of the projects I've worked on during my studies or my spare time.

## Projects
### [Emergency Bracelet Project](https://github.com/Nocxium/Emergency-bracelet)
This projects aim is to provide a device that mainly can monitor if a person is in danger in form of a potential fall accident or a possible medical seizure. This IoT-device is in the form of an bracelet that is thought to be worn by the user and in case of emergency a message will be sent to example relatives of the user so that they can either contact the user or ultimately SOS.

### [People Counter](https://github.com/Nocxium/People_Counter_WS)
This project is a smart people counter designed to monitor and analyze library usage. Utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller and MQTT protocol, it accurately counts the number of individuals in various library areas.

The collected data is transmitted in real-time to a self-hosted MySQL database, where we process the information to determine the distribution of visitors across different floors. This data is then visualized on a dedicated website, providing library staff with valuable insights into usage patterns and enabling better resource management.

### [nChain - Linux Theme Switcher](https://github.com/Nocxium/nChain)
nChain is a theme changer for Linux, with a focus on being very flexible and without any special dependancies (Outside of the basic Linux tools). It works by creating and removing symlinks to your files each time you change a theme.

nChain can be used with many lauchers, such as Rofi, dmenu and Wofi. Or you could just run it directly from the terminal.
